- [XML schema](https://github.com/ilyabo/xmldrill/raw/master/doc/screenshots/xmlschema.png): A random XML schema is generated. The students have to provide a valid XML instance for the schema. 
- [XSLT](https://github.com/ilyabo/xmldrill/raw/master/doc/screenshots/xslt.png): A random input is generated for a given XSL stylesheet. The students have to provide the output of the transformation. 
- [SVG](https://github.com/ilyabo/xmldrill/raw/master/doc/screenshots/svg.png): A random SVG document is generated. The users have to draw it and can then compare to the real output.

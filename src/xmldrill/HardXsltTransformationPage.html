    <h3>Hard XSLT Transformation</h3>
    
    <p>
    The stylesheet below has rule conflicts.
    In general, in such cases the most specific rule has a higher priority and is applied first.
    For instance, a rule with match="*" is always the least specific, a rule with match="A[@B]" is very specific and
    has a high priority.  
    You can read more about the conflict resolution for template rules 
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt#conflict">here</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    We oversaw that there is one unresolvable conflict in this stylesheet between 
    the rules with match="C" and match="C|D". match="C|D" is equvalent to two rules: match="C" and match="D". 
    That means that there are two rules in the stylesheet with match="C" which naturally have the same priority.
    The order in which they are applied is undefined (by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt">XSLT recommendation</a>)
    and thus depends on the implementation of the XSLT processor.  
    </p>
    
    <p><b>Good news:</b> There will be no stylesheets with rule conflicts in the exam.</p>
